# Go String Utilities

The following repo is a collection of string functions I have created over the years, and slowly moving them to a single package, helping me and others to enjoy them, and stop inventing the wheel every project.

## import

The package is built not to support non golang standard library, for minimize dependencies.

# License

The Following project is released under MIT, so enjoy yourself.
